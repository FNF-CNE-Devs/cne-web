### Guidelines for Submitting Mods

1. **Image Resolution**
   All images provided within your mod or related to it **must** adhere to a resolution of **1280x720** or less.
   And have a aspect ratio of **16:9**.
   And have a file extension of **.jpg**. Unless the png version has a smaller file size.
   It is recommended to use a photo editing software like [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) to crop and resize your images.
   You can't have animated gifs or apngs.

2. **Allowed Mods**
   Only **Codename Engine mods** are allowed. Mods pull requests that do not adhere to this standard will not be accepted.

   We don't wish to have ports of mods that were originally made for another engine, unless they are uploaded by the original author.

   **Note:** We don't allow mods that contain piracy or illegal content. If you have any questions, please ask in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WTzm35kekB).

3. **Download Links**
   Providing a full build download link is **discouraged**. Please refrain from including direct links to full builds. Unless your mod is a **hardcoded Codename Engine mod**.

4. **Mod Pack Link**
   If possible, provide a link to a **mod pack** that consolidates your mod with others for easier integration.

5. **Hardcoded Codename Engine Mods**
   - If your mod is a **hardcoded Codename Engine mod**, you **must provide a link** to its source code.
   - In this case, you are **not required** to provide a mod pack link.
   - Additionally, make sure to add the tag `"hardcoded"` to your `meta.json` file for proper categorization.

6. **Softcoded Codename Engine Mods**
   - If your mod is a **softcoded Codename Engine mod**.
   - In this case, you **must provide a mod pack link**.
   - Additionally, make sure to add the tag `"softcoded"` to your `meta.json` file for proper categorization.

7. Unreleased mods
   - If your mod is **not yet released**, you must set the `version` field to `"unreleased"`.
   - and add the tag `"upcoming"` to your `meta.json` file for proper categorization.
   - You also need to set the `lastUpdated` field to `"unreleased"`.

8. Correct timestamps
   - If your mod is **not yet released**, you must set the `lastUpdated` field to `"unreleased"`.
   - If your mod is **released**, you must set the `lastUpdated` field to the date in the format `"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z"`. (Make sure its in UTC)
       - GameBanana: If the mod is on GameBanana you can use this script `document.querySelector(".DateModified time").getAttribute("datetime")` to get the correct date.
       - GameJolt: Open the Inspect Element (F12) on the relative time, and put the date in the format `"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z"`. (Make sure its in UTC)
       - GitHub: Open the latest commit and run the script: `document.querySelector("relative-time").getAttribute("datetime")`
   - If you don't know how to get the correct date, you can use this website https://dencode.com/date/iso8601?v=Put%20the%20date%20here&tz=UTC&decimal-separator=%2E then use the value from ISO8601 Date (Extend) to get the correct date.
